# Most common HTTP status codes

- HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers included in the server’s response that indicate the result of a client’s request. Some of the most common HTTP status codes include:

200 OK: The request was successful, and the response includes the requested data.

201 Created: The request was successful, and the server has created a new resource with the provided data.

204 No Content: The request was successful, but there is no additional data to send in the response. This code is often used in response to DELETE requests.

400 Bad Request: The server cannot understand the request due to a client error, malformed syntax, or invalid parameters.

401 Unauthorized: The client lacks valid credentials to access the requested data or perform the desired action.

403 Forbidden: The client does not have permission to access the requested resource, even with valid authentication credentials.

404 Not Found: The server cannot find the requested resource or endpoint.

500 Internal Server Error: The server encountered an unexpected issue.

503 Service Unavailable: The server is not ready to handle the request, often due to overload or maintenance.

504 Gateway Timeout: The server acting as a gateway or proxy did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.
